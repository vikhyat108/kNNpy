The codes in this directory pertain to functions useful for peak statistics-based analysis of various cosmological models. The description of the various codes contained here are as follows:


"PeakStatistics_2D.py" - To obtain the peak curves of cartesian 2-dimensional (over)density fields for various input cosmologies.

"PeakStatistics_2DHealpix.py" - To obtain the peak curves of healpix projected 2-dimensional (over)density fields for various input cosmologies.
