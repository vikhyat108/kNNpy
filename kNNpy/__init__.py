> A modular Python toolkit for computing **$k$-nearest neighbour (kNN) distributions** — advanced clustering statistics that go beyond the traditional two-point correlation function.

---

## Overview

`kNNpy` is a high-performance package for computing **$k$-nearest neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDFs)** — powerful summary statistics that are sensitive to **all connected $N$-point functions** of the matter density field.

Unlike the standard two-point correlation function, kNN statistics capture **non-Gaussian information**, making them a valuable tool for cosmological inference using modern survey data.
